# About me

I have a degree in mathematics and a master's thesis in computer science.

> I always loved programming and enjoyed coding.   
> I always haven't had enough time because I was teaching math in high school.  
> I always used, whenever I could, my free time to learn and code.

I'm currently trying to get into Neural Networks, especially in GNNs.

> I'm trying hard to write grammarly correct and in some cases understandable English, with Greek being my native language
 (μητρική γλώσσα).
